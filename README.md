# Serial-Port-Device-Tester
The goal of this project is to design and implement a Serial Port Device Tester in C++.
The program allows communication between a computer and an electronic device through a serial port. It can send commands, receive responses, and log all results.
This mimics real-world testing tasks for verifying the performance and reliability of computer peripherals and embedded systems.
